#ENV.IO - Environmental Data to Power Social Change

Our goal, by making environmental related data available and highly visible, is to inspire cities, companies and individuals to find innovative solutions to tackle the most impactful environmental challenges we face.

While the Env.io platform will include all environmental impacts, we will first focus on Waste.

## Zero Waste City Challenge #ZWCC

Building on the City of Vancouver's [Zero Waste 2040 goal](http://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/zero-waste.aspx),
the #ZWCC is a multi-faceted initiative aimed at connecting cities waste reduction initiatives through analytics,
outreach, education, and friendly competition.

## Web Application, Analytics

Most cities perform waste auditing through various means to determine the contents of waste entering landfills.
In Vancouver, initiatives have been introduced in the last five years to reduce the amount of recyclable and
compostable material entering landfills. We don't need to explain why this is bad. Audit reports are available
online (at the link above) describing what Vancouverites throw away. This web application should provide a
data-management service for waste stream auditors of various types (public/private) offering independent
performance reviews and issuing accreditation for good performance.

## Zero Waste City Accreditation

Similar to LEED, ZWCC is an accreditation brand for municipalities, private companies, individual property
owners to subscribe to receive independent auditing and awards for strong performance.

## Outreach, EducationThe web application provides analytical tools, qualitative and quantitative, to
illustrate variations in waste-stream performance across the city. Much like BC Hydro's 'myHydro' UI,
studies have shown that conservation-oriented behaviour is influenced more by education than by infrastructure.
i.e., more bins doesn't translate into better recycling and composting behaviour, but individuals being
shown how they compare to their 'average neighbour' produces measurable improvements in recycling and
composting behaviour.

## Scalability, Zero Waste Challenge

With a flexible scale of comparing performance, with special sensitivity to private information, the
Zero Waste Challenge is a way for municipalities to publicly challenge other municipalities to take on
similar conservation-minded goals. ZWCC provides the interface for municipalities and private corporations
to measure-up against one-another.

While ENV.IO digitizes, demonetizes and democratizes the data and visualizations to enable net zero environmental impact.
